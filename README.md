<h1>PHP FRONT CONTROLLER</h1>


A front controller is a design pattern commonly used in web development to centralize and manage the handling of incoming requests to a web application. It acts as a single entry point for all requests and is responsible for routing the requests to the appropriate handlers or controllers within the application.
